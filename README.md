# Spam-Filter
This application serves as a spam filter.<br>
We got thousands of files with some emails and our assignment was to create a very good spam filter that will learn from these files and then will be experienced to recognise every file if it's a spam or not.<br>
Our spam filter learned all the words that it read through training spam and ham files and sorted them if they are a spam word or ham word.<br>

If some words had been a lot in a spam files, then we recognized them as a spam words.<br>
Due to these directories and our special index our filter decided if the files are spams or not.<br>

For better work we used some OOP features possible in Python.<br>
